in which developers whom are currently looking for new software dev 
roles can acsess to see which states have the most open roles. 

It includes a map of all of the states in the U.S. and data related
to these states and how many open software dev jobs they have. 

A developer will be able to hover over all of the states on the map 
and receive the amount of open software dev jobs in each state along 
with a chart with the trends of how many jobs there are in total 
for the past 5 years across the U.S.

over each state on the map for the relevant data from that year selected 
for each state.
